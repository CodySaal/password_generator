# JavaScript Password Generator

## Description

After being given starter code I added JavaScript to this application in order to generate random passwords based on given criteria  The HTML and CSS was provided but the JavaScript was very limited. This is my first JavaScript project so the main goal was to get comfortable working with the basics like functions and variables.  This application can be used by anyone looking for a secure password. Now you no longer have to try and come up with one on your own. Just answer the prompts as they pop up and in the end you will be given a password matching your needs.

## Usage

To use this application you start by clicking the generate password button. You then input how many characters you would like the password to be. Then four prompts follow where you answer what type of characters you want to include in the password. After answering all the prompts a random password will be generated that fits your criteria. The password will show up on screen.
